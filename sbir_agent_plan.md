# SBIR Grant Agent - Project Plan

## Vision
To create a web-based application that helps small businesses manage their SBIR grants effectively. The application will provide tools for budget tracking, reporting, and compliance, leveraging a simulated AI agent to assist users.

## Features
The application will have the following key features:

1.  **Interactive Dashboard:**
    *   A chart to visualize the grant's budget, showing allocated vs. spent funds.
    *   A list of upcoming important deadlines (e.g., quarterly reports, final reports).

2.  **AI Reporting Assistant:**
    *   A text area where users can input their accomplishments and data for a reporting period.
    *   A button to generate a draft report based on the user's input.
    *   The AI's response will be simulated with a pre-programmed template.

3.  **Compliance Chatbot:**
    *   A chat interface for users to ask questions about SBIR rules and regulations.
    *   The chatbot will provide pre-programmed answers to common questions.
